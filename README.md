# FHIR Model in Go
This module will soon provide you a version independent implementation
of the FHIR® Model (primarily https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html)
in Go. Initially it will cover only parts of the model that are required
to implement FHIRPath (http://hl7.org/fhirpath/N1/) and to parse FHIR®
JSON and XML payload.
